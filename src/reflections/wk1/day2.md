## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo-class is a keyword that you can add to a selector to specify an element. One of the most common ones is the :hover pseudo class which allows you to change elements based on where the user's pointer is hovering. For example, chaning the color of a button that the pointer is hovering on. Some other common pseudo-classes are :active , :target , and :optional.

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is built into css to determine what rules should be used if multiple rules are targeting an element and it's property. Specificity is beneficial because it allows you to style your elements in the way you want.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Trying to debug your css code would be a major problem. If an element has multiple rules that are using the !important feature, it can break the CSS because it is not cascadding properly.
