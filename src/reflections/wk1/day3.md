# Cheating At Design (Day 3)

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
I think how we use shadows to make our designs pop was the best tip I read. I think that it is a noticable effect that can really add to your project. Having a shadow box for certain elements can be pleasing to the eye, and also helps if you want to add interactivity to your webpage such as using cards that expand when a user hovers. 

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I think that design can really affect how or even if people interact with your webpage. You could have all the functionality imaginable created for your project, but if it doesn't appeal to the user it won't be worth the time spent. I think having a good design to your webpage can help establish trust with the user. I also think that designing a webpage correctly can affect the accessibility for users, and improve their experience.
