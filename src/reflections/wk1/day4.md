# Wire Framing (Day 4)

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
A wireframe is used to define and plan how the page is organized, what should go where, and what functionality should be available on the webpage. It's essentially a black and white diagram. They allow you to organize your ideas and get a good feel of how your layout will be. 

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
The first level of a wireframe is the Low-fidelity wireframe. These are useful for creating a rough layout of a website that will help to determine how you want the flow for the user to feel. The second level is the mid-fidelity wireframe. Mid-fidelity wireframes are a little more detailed than low-fidelity, and allow for more of an idea about how elements will fit and be placed in a website, without neccessarily being detailed perfectly. They are also usually created with digital tools to provide more accuracy. The last level of detail in wireframes are high-fidelity wireframes. These are used for projects that are in later stages of development, taking full advantage of pixel space, and convey content that pertains more to the goal of the website. 

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think that wire-frames can be very useful. The way that I look at it is, I can either spend time trying to throw together html, css, and java into a website while changing things constantly to better fit my idea. Or I can simply create a wireframe, and take that time to really think about the direction I want to go. I feel that creating a wire-frame before starting a project will not only speed up the process of development, but also improve the overall design and functionality since everything on the page will have a purpose that is known.
