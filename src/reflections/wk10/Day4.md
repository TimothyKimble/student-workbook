#  C# Enum's (Day 4)

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enumerations offer an easy way to work with sets of related constants. An enumeration, or Enum , is a symbolic name for a set of values. Enumerations are treated as data types, and you can use them to create sets of constants for use with variables and properties.
## How can you modify an Enum?
Enums are customized by changing their base type and member values. By default, the underlying type of an enum is int. This default may be changed by specifying a base when declaring the enum. Another modification you can make to an enum is to set the value of an enum member. By default, the first member of an enum takes the value of zero. If this value doesn't make sense for your enum, you can change it to one or some other number.
## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
We've used IEnumerables which make it to where whatever we pass in will be given it's type whether that is a list or whatever it may be.
