# C# Inheritance (Day 1)

## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.
## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. A derived class can have only one direct base class. A class will inherit all members of the base class. 

## How does accessibility affect inheritance?
When members are inherited, members that were public or protected in the base class may change access specifiers in the derived class.
