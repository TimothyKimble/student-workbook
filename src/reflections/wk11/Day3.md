# SQL Injection (Day 3)
## What is SQL injection?
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.
## What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?
SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi. You can classify SQL injections types based on the methods they use to access backend data and their damage potential.
## How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
A web application firewall (WAF) can detect and block basic SQL injection attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS), both network- and host-based, can be tuned to detect SQL injection attacks. Network-based IDSes can monitor all connections to your database server, and flag suspicious activity. Any input to your web application database should be considered untrustworthy and treated accordingly.

## Afternoon Challenge
It was supposed to be Amazen, but most of the class including myself started working on whiteboard challenges, and had a mini discussion with Jake and Mark.
