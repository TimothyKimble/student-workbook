# Course Reflection (Day 4)

## My thoughts on CodeWorks
I started my Software Development journey a little over a year ago. My brother who is a software enginner encouraged me to play around with different gaming engines, and I got to a point where I needed code to bring my creations to life. I started learning C++ through udemy courses, and I tried to teach myself how to code.

It was alright at first, but when I started getting into more complex subjects, I found myself lost in youtube videos and online resources. That's when I found out about CodeWorks. I realized CodeWorks was a place where we are taught how to learn software languages, and I've tried my best to soak up all the knowledge I could.

Even though there have been topics that I don't fully understand, I've been able to spend lots of time building real applications. Its helped me understand the world of software development, and has only made me love it more.

I plan to keep coding no matter what happens in the next couple weeks. With our final coming up, and the weight of trying to find a job, I realize that I need to breathe and just do my best. Even if I'm not offered a job right away, I'm confident in my abilities as a Software Developer thanks to CodeWorks, and I will keep pushing myself to build exciting applications. 

I'm so thankful for my time at CodeWorks, and if anyone asked me about getting into software development, I would send them straight here. The staff is so supportive of all their students, and they care about each individual who walks through those doors. They want us to succeed. That's what I've enjoyed most about CodeWorks.
