# Chrome Developer Tools (Day 3)

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
You can use console.log to check when and where things are happening, and you can also use console.errors to find any places where type errors might occur. 

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab allows you to manipulate your webpage so you can test and debug your code faster and see the changes you make. 

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
You can use your Sources tab to directly access your html, css, and javascript, and you can manipulate the code from there to debug rather than using the console methods over and over.
