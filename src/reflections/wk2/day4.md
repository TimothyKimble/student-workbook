# The Mistakes I Made as a Beginner Programmer (Day 4)


## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Taking the time to think about what your code is meant to accomplish, and figuring out the general idea of how you want it to work will not only speed up the process of programming, but will help you deliver higher quality content. 

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google is my friend. If I get stuck trying to figure out how to make my code work for too long, and my time box runs out, I'll try to see if other developers on the web have had similar problems. But instead of copying code, I try to understand how and why it works, and then apply it to fit my own purposes. 

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
I think that it is important to deliver quality code, rather than throwing it together. IF I can take the time to understand my code, and search in the right places when I get stuck, I will become a better developer. I also need to remember to take breaks when I get stressed.
