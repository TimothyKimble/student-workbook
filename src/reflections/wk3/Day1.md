## What problem does using exports solve?
  Exporting helps with efficiency because it helps to keep code organized and accessible by documents that require it. 
## How does export differ from export default?
  Exports have to be named the exact same when imported, meanwhile we can name default exports anything we like during import. Also, default exports can be anything. Default Exports are regarded as the most important value.
## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The Module System helps to keep code organized, as well as debug your code. If there is a problem or a file is changed in any way, it is easy to locate.
