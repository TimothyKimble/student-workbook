# JavaScript Promises (Day 2)

## What are the three states of a Promise?
Pending, Resolved and Rejected

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
Promises can be chained together letting developers write cleaner code. Instead of trying to nest a ton of  requests inside each other, you can use promises to chain them together. 

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
.then() is used for when promises are resolved successfully, meanwhile .catch() is for rejected promises.
