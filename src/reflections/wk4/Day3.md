# Async and Await (Day 3)

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
They reduced the boilerplate around promises, and help to avoid breaking the chain limitaion of promises.
## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
  You must use async on your function. 
## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
You can promise more things, the code is much simpler to read, you can have multiple async functions in a series, and debugging becomes easier since everything is synchronus to the compiler.
