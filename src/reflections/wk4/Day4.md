# What is REST (Day 4)

## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Meaning when a RESTful api is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. 
## What does Stateless mean?
The server doesn't remember anything about the user who used the API. Each individual request will contain all the information the server needs to perform the request and return a response. 
## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
After the web link unique identifiers are used to grab specific data from an endpoint that contains the resources required by using the GET method.
