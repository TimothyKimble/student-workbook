# Using Query Parameters (Day 1)

## What is the purpose of a Query String?
Query Strings allow you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or appending that information to the end of a URL. The information is then stored in the query string and is captured by the website when it reads the URL

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
An example of a query parameter is ?a=1&b=2. Query parameters start with a question mark at the front. After the question mark is where you put your key=value. If your query string has multiple parameters, you can separate your parameters with an & symbol. 
## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
Query parameters would be helpful when you need to access certain elements or objects tied to your server. Instead of scrolling through every object on your server, you can access specific elements that you would like to modify in one way or another.
