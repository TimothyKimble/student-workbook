## What is a virtual property?
Virtual properties are additional fields for a given model. Their values can be set manually or automatically with defined functionality. A common virtual property is the full name of a person, composed of user's first and last name. Virtual properties don't persist through the database. They only exist logically and are not written to the document's collection.
