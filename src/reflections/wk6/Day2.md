# How to Use Props (Day 2)

## What are props?
In Vue, props are the way that we pass data from a parent component down to it's child components. 
## What are props used for?
Props are used to change objects without having to reassign everything all the time because props will listen for any changes through their reactive properties. 
## Where can props be used or accessed?
Props can be used in components to pass objects through different areas to change the properties of the object.
