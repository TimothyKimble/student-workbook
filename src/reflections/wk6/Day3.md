# Understanding VueJs Lifecycle Hooks (Day 3)

## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
Lifecycle hooks in vue are the initialization steps in which everything from data observation to compiling the template happens. Lifecycle hooks are used for running functions by default in our applications. 
## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
I have used lifecycle hooks by manipulating the DOM with things such as document.getElementById to inject templates, and from updating data through the use of functions. 
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render. I might use mounting hooks when I need to fetch data for my compent on initialization.
