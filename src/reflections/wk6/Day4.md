# Using Nested Routes (Day 4)

## What is a nested route?
Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other, giving more accesibility and freedom to change certain aspects of your program. 
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
You might use a nested route when you need to access data that is deeper in an api such as when there is an array with objects that have their own arrays. 
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes you can pass parameters through nested routes. You might use them when you want to acess specific information for specific users, such as if you were building a network site, and you wanted to acess a person's profile that had all their previous posts on it.
