#  Pair Programming (Day 1)

## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair Programming is when two programmers share a single workstation. One programmer is called the Driver, who is responsible for typing out the code, while the other is known as the Navigator, but focuses more on overall direction of what they should be working on. The two roles should switch often so that both get experience in driving and navigating, and have a better sense of what is happening in their program. 
## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Pair Programming can lead to clearer articulation of the complexitites and hidden details in coding tasks, better diffusion of knowledge among the team, better transfer of skills, large reduction in coordination efforts, and improved resiliency to interruptions. Pair programming can help development teams improve their productivity and skills. 
## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
Both programmers need to be actively engaged with whatever task they are trying to solve, otherwise there won't be a benefit. Paired Programming can raise the awful question of whether it's a waste of resources because it seems as though you are paying two people to do a single task, when in reality as long as they are working together it is actually beneficial. Another downfall is that both programmers must be communicating vocally, especially the driver, so they both know what is happening and where they are headed to provide a smoother transition. Pair Programming also cannot be forced upon people due to relationship issues that may be simple such as hygiene.
