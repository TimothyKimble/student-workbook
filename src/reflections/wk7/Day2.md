# Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc: an introduction (Day 2)

## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code Documentation is something that as a programmer you should be recording while you are developing your applications. It helps to clear the air about what exactly your code does, and how it works such as the parameters it takes and how your functions are called. Some ways to document your code are things such as writing a README for the repository, creating a HowTo guide for using your code, or Documenting your code in the source itself where you actually use the code through your program. 
## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Code Documentation can help keep your program cleaner and simpler since you can write out the clear idea of what you are trying to accomplish. Based on how you write your documentation, your intelisense can actually help guide you while you write your code to help keep a clear picture of what you are doing. You also have the opportunity to record who has done what through the code to help keep track of your team's work. 
## How important is Code documentation and why?
Code Documentation is very important because it will help not only with keeping your current code clean, but it will help you remember why you wrote things the way you did, and how your functions work. It is also super beneficial for your colleagues who might need to use your code, or want to know why and how your code opperates.
