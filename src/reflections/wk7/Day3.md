# Designing a Strong User Experience  (Day 3)

## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
User Experience is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. The goal is to help users do what they want to do when interacting with your business. You should consider how your online and app experiences are making people feel. You never want to confuse your users or make them feel like they don't matter. By keeping your audience's feelings in mind, you can create strong UX that arranges all of your information and interactions in a way that is pleasing to people. If your user feels good, they are more likely to become customers. 
## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
By taking into account the User Experience, you will not only be able to develop an application that feels good and enjoyable for the user, but your users are more likely to become customers for your business. Everything revolves around how a person feels when using your website or app, if they like your design, they are more likely to participate and recommend your services to others. 
## Why is the User Experience important?
Without a good User Experience, you won't have as many customers because they will feel as though they don't matter. They may be confused with what exactly your goal is, and turn away from your potentially good product because of one poor experience. We need to make sure to always keep the user in mind, and design our applications in such a way that users will want to come back, and share with others.
