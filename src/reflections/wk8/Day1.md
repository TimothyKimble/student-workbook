# An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio (Day 1)

## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A developer portfolio provides a space where you can showcase your work. Being able to prove your worth, and show projects that you are proud to have created or worked on. A developer portfolio can help you get a job in your industry. 
## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
A developer portfolio is effective because it provides multiple benefits. A portfolio helps by giving increased visibility and authority on your craft by being able to show your expertiese on a subject. It also provides a space where you can showcase your personal brand, and stand out from a crowd of candidates in interviews. 
## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
A few of the projects I would include in my developer portfolio are Sprintr, which was a task manager, Buglog which was an application for recording bugs in your software, and Network which was an application used for interacting with your friends. I want to include these because they were very difficult for me at the time, but they are applications that are relevant for people to use. Even though they were difficult, by completing them it only shows my worth.
