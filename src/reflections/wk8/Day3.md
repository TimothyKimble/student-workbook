# Unit Testing (Day 3)

## What is Software Development Testing?
Software development testing is where units of code are tested based on their behavior. You should try to test the smallest ammount of code possible so that you can understand how each unit opperates individually. 
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
There are many benefits for testing your code. The first benefit is that you can have peace of mind that your code is solid. By testing your code, you don't have to worry about it breaking as much. This leads in with another benefit which is confidence in your code. Having confidence in your code helps you identify where the problems actually lie, rather than having to look through everything to find your error because you will know that certain parts work. Testing your code also improves efficiency. Rather than spending days or weeks for a QA to test your code to find simple bugs, you can test it yourself and learn through trial and error, which will only speed up the development of your application. Testing your code will only lead to better design, and future growth. And by testing your code, you can improve your documentation so that other developers can know exactly what your code is meant for. 
## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Some of the downsides of testing in software development are that testing cannot catch each and every bug in an application, it is impossible to evealuate every execution path in every application, and there is a limit to the number of scenarios and test data that the developer can use to verify the source code.
