# Testing in Vue (Day 4)

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
The three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue are unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing. Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. This provides developers with confidence in their code. Component testing lets developers fully assert that their components are working on the DOM to provide users with vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins. E2E testing provides coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application which is what happens when users actually use the application. E2E validates all of the laysers in your application. 
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think that E2E testing is the most useful because if you can test your application from a users standpoint, and everything functions correctly, you know your product is complete. By acting as a user would, and testing your application, you will be able to find most bugs that can become problems, or areas that need to be improved. 
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I think the least useful method of testing is the component testing. Even if you test a component, if something isn't showing up on the DOM or is breaking, you still have to go back into your application and test different units of code to figure out what is breaking.
