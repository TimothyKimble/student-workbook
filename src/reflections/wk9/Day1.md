# Reflect on your capstone project (Day 1)

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are using vue.js, nodejs and scss. We are trying to keep our application mobile friendly and build out most of our backend. We have been doing a lot of partner coding throughout our project so that we all know how our program is working as a team, and can easily step in for one another if a problem arises. 
## What went well so far?
I think that our team is really good at communicating what is going on, and what needs to be done. We did a lot of planning this past week in hopes that it will make it easier for us to code during the week, and understand exactly what needs to be done. 
## What would you do differently? Why?
If I could do anything differently, I think I would try to have us document what we are doing throughout our code a little more. I feel like even though we are rotating frequently so everyone has the opportunity to work on parts of our project, when we switch, most times it takes a while for us to get in the groove since we have to read through a ton of code and try to figure out why it is there. So I'd have us document our code more.
