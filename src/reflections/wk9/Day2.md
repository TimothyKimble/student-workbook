#  Github Actions and How to Use Them (Day 2)

## What is a Github action and how do they work?
GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.
## What benefits do Github actions provide?
GitHub actions make it easy to  automate all your software workflows, whether its building, testing, or deploying your code right from GitHub.
## What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
There are different types of events that you can call for whenever you're working with an action including workflows, schedules, webhooks, externals
These workflow events manage the triggering of the actions. Something like a push, a pull request, or a fork that refers to changes in the repository.
