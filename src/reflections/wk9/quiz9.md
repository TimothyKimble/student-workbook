# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use. 
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Definition of Done otherwise known as DOD represents the organization's formal definition of quality for all Product Backlog Items.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
One example would be something like our network checkpoint from the user point of view. As a user, I can post a description and image for people to react to. 
Another example might be our BugLog where the user can create a bug and add notes to it of what needs to be done, and then they can close that bug once they are finished. 
```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The sprint backlog is created right before the beginning of each sprint. The sprint cannot start without the sprint backlog being ready since that's where tasks are planned, and the progress is tracked.
```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
During the daily stand-up, members of the team usually assign themselves the tasks that they wish to complete for that day.
